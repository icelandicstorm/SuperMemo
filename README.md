## Why
I've been using SuperMemo off and on over many years.  When I use it regularly it works very well.  One of my main problems has been the presentation of data.  There is a lot of detailed information in the SuperMemo FAQ on how to present data through templates.  I always thought that this could be improved but was not sure how.  Then one day it hit me.  Why not leverage the world-wide standard used by web developers to present the data and of course this would be with HTML files and JPEG files that I would create and organize within a directory structure of my choosing on my local hard-drive.  I would also use CSS and JavaScript.
